**4. The project planning**

v0.1(Demo) : recover the all functions of old NinjaKid as mobile app with server. We can play the basic game (don't consider the UI resource or design).
v0.5 : find/add the UI resources so that the app can be looked like a real game.
v1.0 : release to Goolgle store after fixing some bugs and testing for reliable service.
v2.0 : customizing the old features. For example, adding a new map(7*7, 9*9, or unblanced size map), adding a new items, and team play.
